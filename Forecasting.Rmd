```
The lines connect points in chronological order. The relationship is strongly positive at lags 4 and 8, reflecting the strong seasonality in the data. The negative relationship seen for lags 2 and 6 occurs because peaks (in Q4) are plotted against troughs (in Q2)

## Autocorrelation of seasonal and cyclic time series

<li>Trends induce positive correlations in the early lags. </li>
<li>Seasonality will induce peaks at the seasonal lags. </li>
<li>Cyclicity induces peaks at the average cycle length </li>

Naive forecasting methods
```{r}
# forecast is mean /median previsions

fcgoog <- naive(goog, h=20)

# Plot and summarize the forecasts
autoplot(fcgoog)

# Use snaive() to forecast the ausbeer seasonal series
fcbeer <- snaive(ausbeer, h=4* frequency(ausbeer))

# Plot and summarize the forecasts
autoplot(fcbeer)
summary(fcbeer)
```

## Fitted Values and residuals

<b>Residuals should look like white noise </b>
<i>Essential assumptions: </i>
<li>They should be uncorrelated </li>
<li>They should have mean zero </li>
<i>Useful properties (for computing prediction intervals) </i>
<li>They should have constant variance </li>
<li>They should be normally distributed </li>
We can test these assumptions using the <i>checkresiduals()</i> function.

```{r}
# Checking residuals
# Check the residuals from the naive forecasts applied to the goog series
goog %>% naive() %>% checkresiduals()

# Do they look like white noise (TRUE or FALSE)
googwn <- TRUE

# Check the residuals from the seasonal naive forecasts applied to the ausbeer series
ausbeer %>% snaive() %>% checkresiduals()

# Do they look like white noise (TRUE or FALSE)
beerwn <- FALSE
```

## Training and test sets

<i>Forecast "error" </i> = the difference between observed value and its forecast in the test set. Compute accuracy using forecast errors on test data
<b>â‰  residuals </b>
<li>which are errors on the training set (vs. test set) </li>
<li>which are based on one-step forecasts (vs. multi-step) </li>

Evaluating forecast accuracy of non-seasonal methods
```{r}
# Create the training data as train
train <- subset(gold, end = 1000)

# Compute naive forecasts and save to naive_fc
naive_fc <- naive(train, h = 108)

# Compute mean forecasts and save to mean_fc
mean_fc <- meanf(train, h = 108)

# Use accuracy() to compute RMSE statistics
accuracy(naive_fc, gold)
accuracy(mean_fc, gold)

# Assign one of the two forecasts as bestforecasts
bestforecasts <- naive_fc
```

Evaluating forecast accuracy of seasonal methods
```{r}
# Create three training series omitting the last 1, 2, and 3 years
train1 <- window(arrivals[, "UK"], end = c(2011, 4))
train2 <- window(arrivals[, "UK"], end = c(2010, 4))
train3 <- window(arrivals[, "UK"], end = c(2009, 4))

# Produce forecasts using snaive()
fc1 <- snaive(train1, h = 1 * frequency(train1))
fc2 <- snaive(train2, h = 1 * frequency(train2))
fc3 <- snaive(train3, h = 1 * frequency(train3))
# Use accuracy() to compare the MAPE of each series
accuracy(fc1, arrivals[, "UK"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
accuracy(fc2, arrivals[, "UK"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
accuracy(fc3, arrivals[, "UK"])["Test set", "MAPE"]
```

## Time series cross-validation

```{r}
# Using tsCV() for time series cross-validation

# Compute cross-validated errors for up to 8 steps ahead
e <- tsCV(goog, forecastfunction = naive, h = 8)

# Compute the MSE values for each horizon and remove missing values
mse <- colMeans(e^2, na.rm = TRUE)

# Plot the MSE values against the forecast horizon
data.frame(h = 1:8, MSE = mse) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = h, y = MSE)) + geom_point()

```

# Time Series Decomposition

 The first step in a classical decomposition is to use a moving average method to estimate the trend-cycle, so we begin by discussing moving averages.
 
```{r}
autoplot(elecsales, series="Data") +
  autolayer(ma(elecsales,5), series="5-MA") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("GWh") +
  ggtitle("Annual electricity sales: South Australia + Trend-Cycle") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("Data"="grey50","5-MA"="red"),
                      breaks=c("Data","5-MA"))
```

Decomposition
```{r}
par=c(1,2)
elecequip %>% decompose(type = "multiplicative") %>%
  autoplot() + xlab("Year") +
  ggtitle("Classical multiplicative decomposition of electrical equipment index")

elecequip %>% decompose(type = "additive") %>%
  autoplot() + xlab("Year") +
  ggtitle("Classical additive decomposition of electrical equipment index")
```

X11 Decomposition
```{r}
library(seasonal)
elecequip %>% seas(x11="") -> fit
autoplot(fit) +
  ggtitle("X11 decomposition of electrical equipment index")
#The X11 trend-cycle has captured the sudden fall in the data in early 2009 better than either of the other two methods, and the unusual observation at the end of 2009 is now more clearly seen in the remainder component
```

Given the output from the seas() function, seasonal() will extract the seasonal component, trendcycle() will extract the trend-cycle component, remainder() will extract the remainder component, and seasadj() will compute the seasonally adjusted time series.
```{r}
autoplot(elecequip, series="Data") +
  autolayer(trendcycle(fit), series="Trend") +
  autolayer(seasadj(fit), series="Seasonally Adjusted") +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("New orders index") +
  ggtitle("Electrical equipment manufacturing (Euro area)") +
  scale_colour_manual(values=c("gray", "blue","red"),
             breaks=c("Data","Seasonally Adjusted","Trend"))
```

```{r}
# It can be useful to use seasonal plots and seasonal sub-series plots of the seasonal component. These help us to visualise the variation in the seasonal component over time

fit %>% seasonal() %>% ggsubseriesplot() + ylab("Seasonal")
```

# Chapter 3: Exponential smoothing

Forecasts produced using exponential smoothing methods are weighted averages of past observations, with the weights decaying exponentially as the observations get older. In other words, the more recent the observation, the higher the associated weight. This framework generates reliable forecasts quickly and for a wide range of time series, which is a great advantage and of major importance to applications in business.

This method is suitable for forecasting data with no clear trend or seasonal pattern

```{r}
# Use ses() to forecast the next 10 years of winning times
fc <- ses(marathon, h = 10)

# Use summary() to see the model parameters
summary(fc)

# Use autoplot() to plot the forecasts
autoplot(fc)

# Add the one-step forecasts for the training data to the plot
autoplot(fc) + autolayer(fitted(fc))
```

SES vs NAIVE
```{r}
# Create a training set using subset()
train <- subset(marathon, end = length(marathon) - 20)

# Compute SES and naive forecasts, save to fcses and fcnaive
fcses <- ses(train, h = 20)
fcnaive <- naive(train, h = 20)

# Calculate forecast accuracy measures
accuracy(fcses, marathon)
accuracy(fcnaive, marathon)

# Save the best forecasts as fcbest
fcbest <- fcnaive
```

## Exponential smoothing methods with trends: Holt
```{r}
# extended simple exponential smoothing to allow the forecasting of data with a trend. This method involves a forecast equation and two smoothing equations (one for the level and one for the trend)

# Produce 10 year forecasts of austa using holt()
fcholt <- holt(austa, h=10)

# Look at fitted model using summary()
summary(fcholt)

# Plot the forecasts
autoplot(fcholt)

# Check that the residuals look like white noise
checkresiduals(fcholt)
```

Holt with DUMP

"In conjunction with the smoothing parameters alpha and beta âˆ— (with values between 0 and 1 as in Holtâ€™s method), this method also includes a damping parameter 0< phi <1

```{r}
#Holt dump

fc <- holt(AirPassengers, h=15)
fc2 <- holt(AirPassengers, damped=TRUE, phi = 0.9, h=15)
autoplot(AirPassengers) +
  autolayer(fc, series="Holt's method", PI=FALSE) +
  autolayer(fc2, series="Damped Holt's method", PI=FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Forecasts from Holt's method") + xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Air passengers in Australia (millions)") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))

Holt-Winters with monthly data: Additive + Multiplicative
```{r}

# Produce 3 year forecasts for the monthly sales of anti-diabetic drugs in Australia from 1991 to 2008
fc_1<- hw(a10, seasonal = "additive", h = 36)
fc_2<- hw(a10, seasonal = "multiplicative", h = 36)

# Check if residuals look like white noise
checkresiduals(fc_1)
checkresiduals(fc_1)

# Plot forecasts
autoplot(a10) +
  autolayer(fc_1, color="red") +
  autolayer(fc_2, color="green") +
  ggtitle("Forecasts from Holt's method: Additive & Multiplicative") + xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Monthly sales of antidiabetic drugs in AU")  +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title="Forecast")) 
```

Holt-Winters method with daily data
```{r}
# Create training data with subset()
train <- subset(hyndsight, end = length(hyndsight) - 28)

# Holt-Winters additive forecasts as fchw
fchw <- hw(train, seasonal = "additive", h = 28)

# Seasonal naive forecasts as fcsn
fcsn <- snaive(train, h = 28)

# Find better forecasts with accuracy()
forecast::accuracy(fchw, hyndsight)
forecast::accuracy(fcsn, hyndsight)

# Plot the better forecasts
autoplot(fchw)
```

## Forecasting with ETS models : errors, trend, and seasonality (ETS) 

```{r}
# Fit ETS model to austa in fitaus
fitaus <- ets(austa)
summary(fitaus)

# Check residuals
checkresiduals(fitaus) # passes the jung test

# Plot forecasts
autoplot(forecast(fitaus))
```

```{r}
# Repeat for hyndsight data in fiths
fiths <- ets(hyndsight)
summary(fiths)
checkresiduals(fiths) # fail the jung test
autoplot(forecast(fiths))
```

When does ETS fail?
```{r}
# Plot the lynx series
autoplot(lynx)

# Use ets() to model the lynx series
fit <- ets(lynx)

# Use summary() to look at model and parameters
summary(fit)

# Plot 20-year forecasts of the lynx series
fit %>% forecast(h = 20) %>% autoplot()
```

# Chapter 4 : ARIMA models

Box-Cox transformations for time series
```{r}
# Box-Cox transformation to stabilize the variance of the pre-loaded a10 series, which contains monthly anti-diabetic drug sales in Australia from 1991-2008

# Plot the series
autoplot(a10)

# Try four values of lambda (transform. degree) in Box-Cox transformations
a10 %>% BoxCox(lambda = 0) %>% autoplot()
a10 %>% BoxCox(lambda = 0.1) %>% autoplot()
a10 %>% BoxCox(lambda = 0.2) %>% autoplot()
a10 %>% BoxCox(lambda = 0.3) %>% autoplot()

# Compare with BoxCox.lambda()
BoxCox.lambda(a10)
```

Non-seasonal differencing for stationarity
```{r}
# Plot the US female murder rate
autoplot(wmurders)
# Plot the differenced murder rate
diff(wmurders) %>% autoplot()

# Plot the ACF of the differenced murder rate
diff(wmurders) %>% ggAcf() # looks like white noise after differenciationg
```

## Seasonal differencing for stationarity

With seasonal data, differences are often taken between observations in the same season of consecutive years, rather than in consecutive periods. For example, with quarterly data, one would take the difference between Q1 in one year and Q1 in the previous year. This is called seasonal differencing.

Sometimes you need to apply both seasonal differences and lag-1 differences to the same series, thus, calculating the differences in the differences.
```{r}
# Plot the data
autoplot(h02)

# Take logs and seasonal differences of h02
difflogh02 <- diff(log(h02), lag = 12)

# Plot difflogh02
autoplot(difflogh02)

# Take another difference and plot
ddifflogh02 <- diff(difflogh02)
autoplot(ddifflogh02)

# Plot ACF of ddifflogh02
ggAcf(ddifflogh02)

```

Stationarity and differentiation

```{r}
cbind("Billion kWh" = usmelec,
      "Logs" = log(usmelec),
      "Seasonally\n differenced logs" =
        diff(log(usmelec),12),
      "Doubly\n differenced logs" =
        diff(diff(log(usmelec),12),1)) %>%
  autoplot(facets=TRUE) +
    xlab("Year") + ylab("") +
    ggtitle("Monthly US net electricity generation")
```

## ARIMA models:  autoregressive integrated moving average 

Automatic ARIMA models for non-seasonal time series
```{r}
# Fit an automatic ARIMA model to the austa series : select an appropriate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model given a time series
fit <- auto.arima(austa)

# Check that the residuals look like white noise
checkresiduals(fit)
residualsok <- TRUE # p-value > 0.05 (here 0.8067)

# Summarize the model
summary(fit)

# Find the AICc value and the number of differences used
AICc <- -14.46
d <- 1

# Plot forecasts of fit
fit %>% forecast(h = 10) %>% autoplot()
```

## Forecasting with ARIMA models

The Arima() function can be used to select a specific ARIMA model. Its first argument, order, is set to a vector that specifies the values of p, d and q. The second argument, include.constant, is a booolean that determines if the constant c, or drift, should be included

<li>p = numb. of lag-1 diff. </li>
<li>d = nb of ordinary AR lags </li>
<li>q = nb of ordianry MA lags </li>

```{r}
par(mfcol=c(2,2))
# Plot forecasts from an ARIMA(0,1,1) model with no drift
austa %>% Arima(order = c(0,1,1), include.constant = FALSE) %>% forecast() %>% autoplot()

# Plot forecasts from an ARIMA(2,1,3) model with drift
austa %>% Arima(order = c(2,1,3), include.constant = TRUE) %>% forecast() %>% autoplot()

# Plot forecasts from an ARIMA(0,0,1) model with a constant
austa %>% Arima(order = c(0,0,1), include.constant = TRUE) %>% forecast() %>% autoplot()

# Plot forecasts from an ARIMA(0,2,1) model with no constant
austa %>% Arima(order = c(0,2,1), include.constant = FALSE) %>% forecast() %>% autoplot()

```

## Compare models of different classes : Comparing auto.arima() and ets() on non-seasonal data

The AICc statistic is useful for selecting between models in the same class. For example, you can use it to select an ETS model or to select an ARIMA model. However, you cannot use it to compare ETS and ARIMA models because they are in different model classes.

Instead, you can use time series cross-validation to compare an ARIMA model and an ETS model on the austa data. Because tsCV() requires functions that return forecast objects, you will set up some simple functions that fit the models and return the forecasts. The arguments of tsCV() are a time series, forecast function, and forecast horizon h
```{r}
# Set up forecast functions for ETS and ARIMA models
fets <- function(x, h) {
  forecast(ets(x), h = h)
}
farima <- function(x, h) {
  forecast(auto.arima(x), h = h)
}

# Compute CV errors for ETS on austa as e1
e1 <- tsCV(austa, fets, h = 1)

# Compute CV errors for ARIMA on austa as e2
e2 <- tsCV(austa, farima, h = 1)

# Find MSE of each model class
mean(e1^2, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(e2^2, na.rm = TRUE)

# Plot 10-year forecasts using the best model class
austa %>% farima(h = 10) %>% autoplot()
```

## Seasonal ARIMA

<li>D = Number of seasonal differences </li>
<li>P = Number of seasonal AR lags </li>
<li>Q = Number of seasonal MA lags </li>
<li>m = Number of observations per year </li>

Automatic ARIMA models for seasonal time series
```{r}
# Check that the logged h02 data have stable variance
h02 %>% log() %>% autoplot()

# Fit a seasonal ARIMA model to h02 with lambda = 0
fit <- auto.arima(h02, lambda = 0)

# Summarize the fitted model
summary(fit)

# Record the amount of lag-1 differencing and seasonal differencing used
d <- 1
D <- 1

# Plot 2-year forecasts
fit %>% forecast(h = 24) %>% autoplot()
```

## Exploring auto.arima() options

The auto.arima() function needs to estimate a lot of different models, and various short-cuts are used to try to make the function as fast as possible. This can cause a model to be returned which does not actually have the smallest AICc value. To make auto.arima() work harder to find a good model, add the optional argument stepwise = FALSE to look at a much larger collection of models.
```{r}
# Find an ARIMA model for euretail
fit1 <- auto.arima(euretail)

# Don't use a stepwise search
fit2 <- auto.arima(euretail, stepwise = FALSE)

# AICc of better model
AICc <- 68.39

# Compute 2-year forecasts from better model
fit2 %>% forecast(h = 8) %>% autoplot()
```

## Comparing auto.arima() and ets() on seasonal data

```{r}

# Use 20 years of the qcement data beginning in 1988
train <- window(qcement, start = 1988, end = c(2007, 4))

# Fit an ARIMA and an ETS model to the training data
fit1 <- auto.arima(train)
fit2 <- ets(train)

# Check that both models have white noise residuals
checkresiduals(fit1)
checkresiduals(fit2)

# Produce forecasts for each model
fc1 <- forecast(fit1, h = 2) # 1+(4âˆ—(2013âˆ’2007)) 
fc2 <- forecast(fit2, h = 29)

# Use accuracy() to find best model based on RMSE
#accuracy(fc1, qcement)  ?????????
#accuracy(fc2, qcement)
#bettermodel <- fit2
```

# Chapter 5 : Advanced methods

The time series models in the previous chapters work well for many time series, but they are often not good for weekly or hourly data, and they do not allow for the inclusion of other information such as the effects of holidays, competitor activity, changes in the law, etc. In this chapter, you will look at some methods that handle more complicated seasonality, and you consider how to extend ARIMA models in order to allow other information to be included in the them.

## Dynamic Regression

Forecasting sales allowing for advertising expenditure
```{r}
# Regression model allows to include other information

# Time plot of both variables
autoplot(advert, facets=TRUE)

# Fit ARIMA model
fit <- auto.arima(advert[,"sales"], xreg = advert[,"advert"], stationary = TRUE)

# Check fitted model is a regression with AR(1) errors. Increase in sales for each unit increase in advertising
salesincrease <- coefficients(fit)[3]

# Forecast fit as fc
fc <- forecast(fit, xreg = rep(10,6))

# Plot fc with x and y labels
autoplot(fc) + xlab("Month") + ylab("Sales")

```

Forecasting electricity demand

```{r}
str(elecdaily)
frequency(elecdaily)
```

```{r}
# Time plots of demand and temperatures
autoplot(elecdaily[, c("Demand", "Temperature")], facets = TRUE)

# Matrix of regressors
xreg <- cbind(MaxTemp = elecdaily[, "Temperature"], 
              MaxTempSq = elecdaily[, "Temperature"]^2, 
              Workday = elecdaily[, "WorkDay"])

# Fit model
fit <- auto.arima(elecdaily[, "Demand"], xreg = xreg)

# Forecast fit one day ahead
fc <- forecast(fit, xreg = cbind(20, 20^2, 1))
fc

# PLot

autoplot(elecdaily[,"Demand"]) +
  autolayer(fc)
```

## Dynamic Harmonic Regression

<i>Forecasting weekly data </i>

With weekly data, it is difficult to handle seasonality using ETS or ARIMA models as the seasonal length is too large (approximately 52). Instead, you can use harmonic regression which uses sines and cosines to model the seasonality.

```{r}
# The fourier() function makes it easy to generate the required harmonics. The higher the order (K), the more "wiggly" the seasonal pattern is allowed to be. With K=1, it is a simple sine curve. You can select the value of K by minimizing the AICc value. Function fourier(x, K, h = NULL) takes in a required time series, required number of Fourier terms to generate, and optional number of rows it needs to forecast:

# Set up harmonic regressors of order 13
harmonics <- fourier(gasoline, K = 13)

# Fit regression model with ARIMA errors
fit <- auto.arima(gasoline, xreg = harmonics, seasonal = FALSE)

# Forecasts next 3 years
newharmonics <- fourier(gasoline, K = 13, h = 156) # 156= 3 (years) * 52 (weeks as data is weekly)
fc <- forecast(fit, xreg = newharmonics)

# Plot forecasts fc
autoplot(fc)
```

## Harmonic regression for multiple seasonality

```{r}

The seasonal periods are 48 (daily seasonality: 24h * 2) and 7 x 48 = 336 (weekly seasonality). 

auto.arima() would take a long time to fit a long time series such as this one, so instead you will fit a standard regression model with Fourier terms using the tslm() function. This is very similar to lm() but is designed to handle time series. With multiple seasonality, you need to specify the order K for each of the seasonal periods.

```{r}
# Fit a harmonic regression using order 10 for each type of seasonality
fit <- tslm(taylor ~ fourier(taylor, K = c(10, 10)))

# Forecast 20 working days ahead
fc <- forecast(fit, newdata = data.frame(fourier(taylor, K = c(10, 10), h = 20*48)))

# Plot the forecasts
autoplot(fc)

# Check the residuals of fit
checkresiduals(fit) # fails the white noise test, yest the forecast seems pretty good
```

## Forecasting call bookings (every 5 minutes)

Another time series with multiple seasonal periods is calls, which contains 20 consecutive days of 5-minute call volume data for a large North American bank. There are 169 5-minute periods in a working day, and so the weekly seasonal frequency is 5 x 169 = 845. The weekly seasonality is relatively weak, so here you will just model daily seasonality

```{r}
# Plot the calls data
autoplot(calls)

# Set up the xreg matrix using order 10 for daily seasonality and 0 for weekly seasonality.
xreg <- fourier(calls, K = c(10, 0))

# Fit a dynamic regression model
fit <- auto.arima(calls, xreg = xreg, seasonal = FALSE, stationary = TRUE)

# Check the residuals
checkresiduals(fit)

# Plot forecasts for 10 working days ahead
fc <- forecast(fit, xreg =  fourier(calls, c(10, 0), h = 10  * 169))
autoplot(fc)
```

## TBATS models

<li>Trigonometric terms for seasonality </li>
<li>Box-Cox transformations for heterogeneity </li>
<li> ARMA errors for short-term dynamics </li>
<li>Trend (possibly damped) </li>
<li>Seasonal (including multiple and non-integer periods) </li>

```{r}
# Plot the gas data
autoplot(gas)

# Fit a TBATS model to the gas data
fit <- tbats(gas)

# Forecast the series for the next 5 years
fc <- forecast(fit, h = 12 * 5)

# Plot the forecasts
autoplot(fc)

# Record the Box-Cox parameter and the order of the Fourier terms
lambda <- 0.082
K <- 5
